/**
 * This is the core representation of a piece of data, more specifically an integer.
 * There is a width, which is set at the time of creation, and a height which
 * is proportional to it's value. It will be scaled so that the highest value in
 * the data set will own the rectangle with the maximum height, and the smallest
 * value will own the rectangle with the smallest height. This encapsulates a rectangle
 * plus an integer value, which is used when sorting.
