THESE KIND WORDS HAVE ADOPTED US
ACCEPTED WITHOUT QUESTION
WE LIVE TO LOVE
WE LOVE TO LIVE
A PEACEFUL GIFT

WE CLAIM TO BE GRATEFUL
THOUGH IT ISN'T CERTAIN
STANDING IN PURE DARKNESS PRAYING FOR THE LIGHT
PONDERING RECENT FRAMES
ALLOWING ACCESS TO MISTAKES I MAY HAVE MADE

WHERE ARE THEY
WHERE ARE THEY NOW

AS I STARE INTO A WHOLE MADE UP OF DISMAY
THEY NOW FACE ME
GAZING BLANKLY INTO MY EYES

ALL AT ONCE SHATTERING
LEAVING ONLY THE SHARDS TO BE REPLACED

I AM PUTRID
LAY ASIDE THE GOOD THAT I HAVE DONE

BUT I AM ALIVE

AS I STARE INTO A WHOLE MADE UP OF DISMAY
THEY NOW FACE ME
GAZING BLANKLY INTO MY EYES

ONLY THE SHARDS TO BE REPLACED WITH GUILT
I AM PUTRID
